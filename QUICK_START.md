## Understanding the Grading System

The plugin uses **Bangladeshi GPA 5.0 Scale**:

| Marks Range | Grade | GPA |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| 80-100      | A+    | 5.0 |
| 70-79       | A     | 4.0 |
| 60-69       | A-    | 3.5 |
| 50-59       | B     | 3.0 |
| 40-49       | C     | 2.0 |
| 33-39       | D     | 1.0 |
| 0-32        | F     | 0.0 |

**Important:** If a student fails (F grade) in any subject, their overall GPA becomes 0.0

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Enter All Results Before Calculating Positions**
   - Positions are calculated based on complete data

   - This ensures proper filtering

3. **Upload Student Photos**
   - Photos make the display more professional
   - Recommended size: 300x300px
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF

4. **Keep Terms Organized**
   - Mark completed terms as "Completed"
   - Keep only active term as "Active"

5. **Regular Backups**
   - The plugin stores data in WordPress database
   - Regular WordPress backups protect your data

## Troubleshooting

### Results Not Showing
- Verify student ID and term ID are correct
- Check if results are entered for that student and term

### Positions Not Calculated
- Click "Calculate Positions" button
- Ensure all students have results entered

### Photo Not Uploading
- Check file size (should be under 2MB)
- Verify file format (JPG, PNG, GIF only)
- Check WordPress upload directory permissions

### GPA Seems Wrong
- Verify marks are entered correctly
- Remember: F in any subject = 0.0 overall GPA
